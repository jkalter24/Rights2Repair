                <h3>The Unintended Consequences of Right-to-Repair Laws</h3>
            </a>
                <p>Right to repair isn't just helping people keep their devices for long but it can also have far bigger impacts. For example an unintended side effect
                    of right to repair laws is that it can help reduce the amount of electronic waste that is produced. This is because people are able to fix their devices
                    instead of throwing them away and buying new ones. This can help reduce the amount of electronic waste that is produced and help protect the environment. 
                    Some Manufacturers even go as far as to produce cheap goods damaging the environment.

                <h3>Effects Right To Repair has in the real world.</h3>
            </a>
                <p>With technology quickly evolving it is becoming more prominent in lots of spheres. One area technology has become extremely popular with is education.
                    Trusting kids with technology can be very risky, but with the right to repair it can be a lot easier. Kids can learn how to fix their own devices and learn how to keep their devices in good condition.
                    A great example of Right to Repair legislation being beneficial in education would be Samuel Lyons, who works in a county K-12 school systems IT Department. Throughout this blurb he highlights the challenges faced when
                    repairing tablets with smashed displays. Due to things like Part Paring (when a manufacturer uses software to identify and confirm the authenticity of component parts through a unique identifier) when replacing displays the suppliers struggle to 
                    provide all original equipment (OEM) and as a result certain features like the camera become non functional.

                <h3>Right To Repair legislation efforts</h3>
            </a>
                <p>
                    Recently the EU has officially adopted to new set of rules pertaining to right to repair. These rules are designed to encourage people to repair
                    their broken devices. Rather than buy a new one and replace them. One of the rules implemented extends a product warranty by a year if it get repaired while still under warranty.
                    Additionally the EU even went further as to require manufacturers to provide repairs to common household products even after the warranty period ends. Those items can include
                    SmartPhones, TV's, Washing Machines, Vacuum Cleaners and other items. They also stated that all of these repairs need to be offered at a "reasonable" price so customers are not deterred from getting their products fixed. 
                    This is a great step in the right direction as it encourages people to repair their devices rather than replace them. This can help reduce the amount of electronic waste that is produced and help protect the environment.
