                                Education plays a huge part of today’s society. 
                                Several consumers just don’t know that certain options are 
                                available to them. We plan to hold potential workshops in 
                                educating the general public and also providing talks at various 
                                schools. To apply change, we must educate people of all ages and 
                                backgrounds. Even producers need to be educated in regards to how 
                                their products are being disposed of, and we should hold them 
                                accountable. They play a part in also educating the consumer 
                                in proper methods of maintenance, recycling, and more.

                                Products used to be built to last. Now, they are built 
                                to be used every few years, then consumers get a replacement. 
                                Ask yourself, how often do you get a new phone? Why do you 
                                get a new phone? Is it because it broke, or is it because your 
                                phone becomes too slow, or because the company no longer 
                                supports that device? After answering and thinking about 
                                these questions, think about this. How do you dispose of 
                                your old phone? Do you throw it away? Do you sell it? 
                                Do you try to get it repaired? Very rarely it’s the latter. 
                                When consumers throw away their electronics, as an example 
                                this produces a lot of e-waste. Which contaminates drinking 
                                water and polluting ecosystems around the globe. Only a few 
                                electronics are actually recycled, and those that aren’t are 
                                put into landfills or burned in another country which enhances 
                                the problem. We need to get companies to build things that 
                                last, or educate their consumers in proper recycling or 
                                repairing techniques, and they should work with recycling 
                                companies to contribute to creating more recycling areas, 
                                and ensure that their items are being discarded in a safe 
                                and in an environmentally friendly way.

                                As an organization we will work to create right to repair 
                                laws allowing consumers to actually own the product that 
                                they buy. This will allow them for the right to use, to 
                                modify, and to repair. With these laws, everyone should 
                                be given the right to proper manuals from producers, 
                                the right to choose which service shop we use, and the 
                                right to look into the software on our personal devices. 
                                Manufacturers have created a monopoly on repair, for example 
                                Apple has created special screws for their devices making 
                                it even harder to repair them at a service shop. Several 
                                companies drive prices up and drive down competition for 
                                themself, we should not give them that option! It’s obvious 
                                that numerous companies don’t want people to repair their 
                                items. Many companies refuse to sell replacement parts to 
                                independent service shops, which is very unfair. There 
                                are various repair cafes and numerous people to help, 
                                however, we as an organization need to give pressure 
                                in applying right to repair laws.
